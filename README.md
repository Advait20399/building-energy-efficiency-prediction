# üè¢ Building Energy Efficiency Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for **predicting building energy efficiency** using the **Group H Building Energy Dataset**.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean building energy dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand efficiency patterns  
- Train machine learning / deep learning models for prediction  
- Evaluate model performance with metrics (MAE, RMSE, R¬≤)  
- Predict building energy efficiency for new/unseen data  

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/building-energy-efficiency-prediction.git
cd building-energy-efficiency-prediction
```

2. Install required dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook  
```bash
jupyter notebook building_energy_efficiency.ipynb
```

## Applications
- Sustainable building design  
- Energy efficiency benchmarking  
- Smart grid and HVAC optimization  
- Policy and planning for green buildings
