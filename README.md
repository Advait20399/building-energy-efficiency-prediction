# üè¢ Building Energy Efficiency Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for **predicting building energy efficiency** using the **Group H Building Energy Dataset**.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and clean building energy dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand efficiency patterns  
- Train machine learning / deep learning models for prediction  
- Evaluate model performance with metrics (MAE, RMSE, R¬≤)  
- Predict building energy efficiency for new/unseen data  

## Applications
- Sustainable building design  
- Energy efficiency benchmarking  
- Smart grid and HVAC optimization  
- Policy and planning for green buildings
